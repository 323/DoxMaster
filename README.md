DoxMaster
=========

A program for easily doxing people.

DoxMaster is written in Java, just because I already have HTTP Libraries for that language (Thanks to Isonyx!)

At the moment I'm attempting to add HTTPS support to his libraries, which is why you may see random HTTPS files in there. Once I fully add support, I'm going to ask him to merge it with the main HTTPRequest Github master branch so that everyone will have HTTPS support, since it's kind of a big thing.

Anyway, this program is far from finished, but when finished will have a large amount of features:

- Search the person on Facebook
- Search the person on Twitter
- Keep a log of high-frequency words (Words they use a lot)
- Keep a log of the about of their facebook and bio of their twitter to find more links/phone numbers/emails/birthdays
- Use Twitter and Facebook to find more information about where they live, other sites they visit, and things like that.
- Search them in the Whitepages, KGBPeople, and a few other sites

Besides that, I have more features coming soon, but you'll just have to wait and see.

I kind of never finish projects, so sorry if this never gets done. If you really need it just PM me, and I can make sure and work on it more haha.

Anyway, enjoy!
